USAGE:  long-orfs [options] <sequence-file> <output-file>

Read DNA sequence in <sequence-file> and find and output the
coordinates of long, non-overlapping orfs in it.
Output goes to file <output-file> or standard output if <output-file>
is "-"

Options:
 -A <codon-list>
 --start_codons <codon-list>
    Use comma-separated list of codons as start codons
    Sample format:  -A atg,gtg
 -E <filename>
 --entropy <filename>
    Read entropy profiles from <filename>.  Format is one header
    line, then 20 lines of 3 columns each.  Columns are amino acid,
    positive entropy, negative entropy.  Rows must be in order
    by amino acid code letter
 -f
 --fixed
    Do *NOT* automatically determine the minimum gene length so as
    to maximize the total length of output regions
 -g <n>
 --min_len <n>
    Only genes with length >= <n> will be considered
 -h
 --help
    Print this message
 -i <filename>
 --ignore <filename>
    <filename> specifies regions of bases that are off 
    limits, so that no bases within that area will be examined
 -l
 --linear
    Assume linear rather than circular genome, i.e., no wraparound
 -L
 --length_opt
    Find and use the minimum gene length that maximizes the total
    length of non-overlapping genes, instead of maximizing the
    number of such genes
 -n
 --no_header
    Do not include heading information in the output; only output
    the orf-coordinate lines
 -o <n>
 --max_olap <n>
    Set maximum overlap length to <n>.  Overlaps this short or shorter
    are ignored.
 -t <x>
 --cutoff <x>
    Only genes with entropy distance score less than <x> will be considered
 -w
 --without_stops
    Do *NOT* include the stop codon in the output coordinates.
    By default, it is included.
 -z <n>
 --trans_table <n>
    Use Genbank translation table number <n> for stop codons
 -Z <codon-list>
 --stop_codons <codon-list>
    Use comma-separated list of codons as stop codons
    Sample format:  -Z tag,tga,taa
